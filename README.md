# SwagSnake
My version-or should I say-the swag version of the Snake game found in Bijoyan Das' Javascript Game Dev Course.
# How To Play
     1. If you are on a laptop/pc, use the arrow keys.
     2. If you are on a mobile device, use the onscreen arrows(you can use the onscreen arrows on a touchscreen laptop/pc as well).
If you have somehow never heard of the gameplay of Snake, you are a snake and you have to eat the apples.

    -touch and keyboard controls
    -particles on collision with apple 
    -stylish dancing cubes
    -60 fps gameplay
